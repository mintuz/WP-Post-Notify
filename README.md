# WP-Post-Notify
==============

* A small plugin to notify people of a new post via email, a bit like a mailing list but without the extra bloat.
* The plugin uses Twitter bootstrap style forms & buttons for the frontend widget. It's pretty easy to restyle if you know css, visit http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html#forms for more information.

## How to use

* Simply download, unzip, upload folder to /wp-content/plugins/, activiate plugin and start posting.
* Very simple to use, add WPPTemplateTags::show_subscribe_widget() to your theme where you want the subscribe widget to be displayed. Alternativey if your theme supports it, widget support is available because I'm nice like that.
* Publish a new post in wp-admin and the meta box to send a notification email about the new post will be displayed. click this button and bam !!!! notified.
